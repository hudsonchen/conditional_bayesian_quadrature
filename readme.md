# Conditional Bayesian Quadrature

This repository contains the implementation of the code for the paper "Conditional Bayesian Quadrature". In the code, the algorithm proposed in the paper is "CBQ", the baseline methods are Least-square Monte Carlo (LSMC), Kernel Mean Shrinkage estimator (KMS), and Importance Sampling (IS).

## Installation

To install the necessary requirements, use the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Reproducing Results

### Bayesian Sensitivity Analysis

To reproduce the results for Bayesian sensitivity analysis (Figure 2 (Left & Middle)), run the following command:

python bayes_sensitivity.py --dim 2 --g_fn g3 --kernel_x RBF  --kernel_theta Matern

You can vary the dimension by altering the argument 'dim --2' to reproduce Figure 2 (Right).

### Black-Scholes Model

To reproduce the results for the Black-Scholes model using Stein kernels (Figure 4 (Left)), run:

python black_scholes.py --kernel_theta rbf --kernel_x stein_matern

And to reproduce the results for the Black-Scholes model not using Stein kernels (Figure 4 (Left)), run:

python black_scholes.py --kernel_theta rbf --kernel_x log_normal_rbf

### SIR Model

To reproduce the results for the SIR model (Figure 4 (Middle)), run:

python SIR.py

### Health Economics

To reproduce the results for uncertainty decision making in health economics (Figure 5), run:

python health_economics.py
